This React Native bug involves unexpected behavior when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and frequent updates.  The issue manifests as slow scrolling, dropped frames, and occasional crashes.  The problem is exacerbated when complex components are rendered within each item of the `FlatList`.  Specifically, the performance degrades significantly when using components that themselves perform complex calculations or network requests within their `render` method.  The code below demonstrates a simplified example using a large array of numbers to render list items. Each item calculates a complex mathematical function.
